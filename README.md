# BlackJack

Milestone Project # 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

Deployed Site: https://aprilha3097.github.io/BlackJack/

Blackjack is a simple game of cards. I created this game to challenge my skillset adapting to the complex rules to playing the game blackjack. I created this site using HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript.

## UX and Elements of User Experiences
### Strategy

This sites obejective is to produce something that is for people who enjoy the game of blackjack that can easily play at home or on a mobile device against a computer dealer. 

### Scope 

Functional Requirements: 
* User able to read instructions and easily return back to the title screen prior to starting the game
* Encourage users to choose specific buttons to correctly follow through the logic of the game
    - Deal button will be disabled when it is users turn
    - Hit button will be disabled when it is dealers turn
    - Hit button will be active after user presses Deal to reset the game board
* Total score will be presented for both the player and dealers card values at head of the page
* Once user or dealer hits 21 or goes over 21 and busts, no more cards will be dealt
* Clicking Deal should clean board back to start of game

Content Requirements: 
* For every backend randomised card value a front end card image will be produced

### Structure

Information Architecture 
* Title screen - buttons are clearly labelled in the middle of the screen - text on the buttons clearly state what users are able to choose from
* When user presses 'How to Play', the instructions appear on a modal window, user can press the 'X' or off of the modal to exit the instructions screen
* The Start button will take users to the main game area once player is ready to play
* User and dealers scores are both at 0 - indiciating a numerical value to be updated
* Status will change once both player and dealer have completed their turns to indicate winner or losser in clear text
* Table at bottom clearly labelled with Wins, Losses and Draws for the users reference of their progress through the game
* As this is a card game, images of cards will represent their actual value
* Buttons are clearly labelled - buttons that are not active/disabled will not be highlighted
* For each card draw a sound effect to let users know what to expect
* A positive or win sound for everytime the player wins
* A negative or lose sound for everytime the player losses

### Skeleton 

#### Wireframes

### Mobile
Mobile version is recommended to be used on a landscape mode. The script 'pleaserotate.min.js' will ask users to rotate screens on certain devices.

### User Stories: 

* As a user, I want a start button to initialise the game
* As a user, I want to reset the game whenever I want
* As a user, I want to have options to Stay or Bet, so thatI can have freedom in choice/options
* As a user, I want to know how much my cards add up to, so that I donâ€™t need to add up the total of my cards value myself
* As a user, I want to know who has one that round
* As a user, I want to know where I am in terms of winning and losing

### Features:

Title Screen: 
* The site will first load the title screen. User will be given two options to Start the game or to read the instructions on How to Play
* Pressing the Start button will intialise the game and enter the main game section
* If player selects 'How to Play' a modal box will appear with the isntructions of the game

Main Game: 
* Player will have three buttons to 'Hit', 'Stay' or 'Deal'
* Player needs to press 'Hit' to initiate the game by dealing the players cards
* Once player has completed their turn, they will press 'Stay' to end their turn and initiaite the Dealers turn - 'Hit' button will be disabled
* Once Dealers turn is over, user will need to press the 'Deal' button. Once selected the card images will be removed, the score will revert to 0 and the status of the game will go back to 'Let's Play'
* For every card that is dealt the total calue of the card will be presented for the player and dealer
* When user hits 21, no more cards can be dealt and 21 is highlighted in green
* When user busts, no more cards can be dealt and the value will change to BUST! in red
* Once Stay has been clicked and dealers hand is dealt, the top status will change to Player has won, lost or no winner meaning there was a draw
* The below table will be updated depending on win, lose, or draw from that round
* The table will be updated with how many wins losses and draws collected from all of the rounds
* For each onclick of the 'Hit' button and for the Dealers cards being drawn a SFX of a card being drawn will play
* For each time the player wins - a winning sound will play after dealers turn
* For each time the player losses - a lossing sound will play after the dealers turn 

### Features to be implemented 
* Backend logic of the Ace card should either be 1 or 11. In real Blackjack, Ace can either be 1 or 11 depending on the users choice of where they curently stand in the game. The logic to do this is still in progress, so this is yet to be implemented within the application
* OR a prompt can be available for when an ACE card is drawn. User can choose between 1 or 11 to be the value they want added to their score
* Add logic so when user goes Bust the dealers cards will get drawn immediately, as user does not need to "stay" as they have already lost
