# BlackJack

Deployed Site: https://aprilha3097.github.io/BlackJack/

Blackjack is a simple game of cards. I created this game to challenge my skillset adapting to the complex rules to playing the game blackjack. I created this application using HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Javascript. 


## UX

## User Stories: 
As a user, I want a start button to initialise the game. 
As a user, I want to reset the game whenever I want.
As a user, I want to have options to Stay or Bet, so that I can decide my next move.
As a user, I want to know how much my cards add up to, so that I donâ€™t need to add up the total of my cards value myself.
As a user, I want to know who has one that round. 
As a user, I want to know where I am in terms of winning and lossing.
